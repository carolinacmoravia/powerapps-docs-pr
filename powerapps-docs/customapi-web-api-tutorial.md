# Build a custom connector for a Web API in PowerApps
This tutorial shows you how to start bulding an ASP.NET Web API, host it on Azure Web Apps, enable Azure Active Directory authentication, and then register the ASP.NET Web API in PowerApps. After the API is registered, you can connect to it and call it from your app.

## Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
* A [PowerApps account](https://powerapps.microsoft.com).
* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) 2013 or higher.

## Create an ASP.NET Web API and deploy it to Azure
1. In Visual Studio, click **File** > **New Project** to create a new C# ASP.NET web application.
   
    ![New Web App](./media/customapi-web-api-tutorial/newwebapp.png)
2. Select the **Web API** template.  Leave **Host in the cloud** checked.  Click **Change Authentication**.
   
    ![New Web Project Template](./media/customapi-web-api-tutorial/new-web-api.png)
3. Select **No Authentication**, and then click **OK**.
   
    ![No Authentication](./media/customapi-web-api-tutorial/noauth.png)
4. Click **OK** on the **New ASP.NET Project** dialog.  The Configure Microsoft Azure Web App dialog appears.
   
    ![Configure Microsoft Azure Web App](./media/customapi-web-api-tutorial/azure-publishing.png)]
   
    Select your Azure account, type a **Web App name** (or leave the default), and select your Azure **Subscription**.  Select or create an **App Service plan** (a collection of Web Apps within your subscription).  Select or create a **Resource group** (a grouping of Azure resources within your subscription).  Select the region where the Web App should be deployed.  If required for your Web API, select or create an Azure **Database server**.  Finally, click **OK**.
5. Build out your Web API.
   
    > [!NOTE]
> If you don't already have code ready for a Web API, try the tutorial [Getting Started with ASP.NET Web API 2 (C#)](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api).
6. To connect our Web API to PowerApps, we'll need an [OpenAPI](http://swagger.io/) file that describes its operations.  You could write an OpenAPI of your own using the [online editor](http://editor.swagger.io/), but for this tutorial, you'll use an open-source tool named [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/blob/master/README.md).  Install the Swashbuckle Nuget package in your Visual Studio project by clicking **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**, and then, in the Package Manager Console, type the command `Install-Package Swashbuckle`.
   
    ![Install-Package Swashbuckle](./media/customapi-web-api-tutorial/swashbuckle-console.png)
   
    > [!TIP]
> When you run your Web API application after installing Swashbuckle, an OpenAPI file will now be generated at the URL `http://<your root URL>/swagger/docs/v1`.  A generated user interface is also available at `http://<your root URL>/swagger`.
7. When your Web API is ready, publish it to Azure. To publish from Visual Studio, right-click on the web project in Solution Explorer, click **Publish...**, and then follow the prompts in the Publish dialog.
8. Retrieve the OpenAPI JSON by navigating to `https://<azure-webapp-url>/swagger/docs/v1`.  Save the content as a JSON file.  Depending on your browser, you may need to copy and paste the text into an empty text file.   
   
    > [!IMPORTANT]
> An OpenAPI document with duplicate operation IDs is invalid. If you are using the sample C# template, the operation ID `Values_Get` is repeated twice. You can correct this by changing one instance to `Value_Get` and re-publishing. You can also download a [sample OpenAPI file](http://pwrappssamples.blob.core.windows.net/samples/webAPI.json) from this tutorial. Be sure to remove the comments (starting with `//`) before using it.

## Set up Azure Active Directory authentication
You will now create two Azure Active Directory (AAD) applications in Azure.  For an example of how to do this, see the [Azure Resource Manager tutorial](customapi-azure-resource-manager-tutorial.md#enable-authentication-in-azure-active-directory).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both apps must be in the same directory.

### First AAD application: Securing the Web API
The first AAD application is used to secure the Web API. Name it **webAPI**.  Follow the above linked tutorial steps (just the section titled "Enable authentication in Azure Active Directory") with the following values:

* Sign-on URL: `https://login.windows.net`
* Reply URL: `https://<your-root-url>/.auth/login/aad/callback`
* There is no need for a client key.
* There is no need to delegate any permissions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note the application ID.  You will need it later.

### Second AAD application: Securing the custom connector and delegated access
The second AAD application is used to secure the custom connector registration and acquire delegated access to the Web API protected by the first application. Name this one **webAPI-customAPI** .

* Sign-on URL: `https://login.windows.net`
* Reply URL: `https://msmanaged-na.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect`
* Add permissions to have delegated access to Web API.
* You need the application ID of this application later as well, so note it.
* Generate a client key and store is somewhere safe. We need this key later.

## Add authentication to your Azure Web App

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and then find your Web App that you deployed in the first section.

2. Click **Settings**, and then select **Authentication / Authorization**.

3. Turn on **App Service Authentication** and then select **Azure Active Directory**.  On the next blade, select **Express**.  

4. Click **Select Existing AD App**, and select the **webAPI** AAD application you created earlier.

You should now be able to use AAD to authenticate your web application.

## Add the custom connector to PowerApps
1. Modify your OpenAPI file to add the `securityDefintions` object and AAD authentication used for the Web App. The section of your OpenAPI file with the **host** property should look like this:

```javascript
    // File header should be above here...

    "host": "<your-root-url>",
    "schemes": [
        "https"         //Make sure this is https!
    ],
    "securityDefinitions": {
        "AAD": {
            "type": "oauth2",
            "flow": "implicit",
            "authorizationUrl": "https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize",
            "scopes": {}
        }
    },

    // The rest of the OpenAPI document follows...
```

1. Browse to [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com), and add a custom connector as described in [Register and use custom connectors in PowerApps](register-custom-api.md).

2. Once you have uploaded your OpenAPI file, the wizard auto-detects that you are using AAD authentication for your Web API.

3. Configure the AAD authentication for the custom connector.  
   
   * **Client ID**: *Client ID of webAPI-CustomAPI*
   * **Secret**: *Client key of webAPI-CustomAPI*
   * **Login URL**: `https://login.windows.net`
   * **ResourceUri**: *Client ID of webAPI*
4. Click **Create** and creating a connection to the custom connector.
